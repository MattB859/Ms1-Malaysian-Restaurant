    ###  Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

    -    #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the restaurant.

        1. When entering the website, users are instantly greeted with a clean and easy to read navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with text and a "Sign Up" call to action button which opens a "modal" for visitors to sign up using a email address and password.

        2. The Hero Image and text immediately lets visitors know what the website is all about.

        3. The user has three options, click the call to action button, click the links in the navigation bar or scroll down to learn more about the restaurant.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The website has been designed to be user-friendly and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what section of the website or page they will end up on.

        2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection button which navigates back to the top of the page to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.

        3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought back to the main home page. 

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find all social media links so that I can follow the pages and keep up to date with new content posted.

        1.  All social media links can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the page.

        2. The user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube icons and with one click will be directed to the social media page which will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.

        3. If the user is on the "Contact" page they will also have access to all social media icons in the footer so they never have to feel restricted on any page.

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added pictures in the gallery.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily navigate with ease.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the gallery link.

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.

        2.  To the right hand side of the footer the user can see "Subscribe to our Newsletter" and are prompted to Enter their email address.
